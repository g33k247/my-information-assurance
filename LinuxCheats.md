# Details #
**Reference:****Basics:** Getting help:

# View the manual for target command
man command

# Get help with a target command (probably the same as above, but not always):
command -h

# In case you forget the name of a command, print possible commands relating to any given word:
apropos word

# View index of help pages:
info

**Command Line Utilities:****Basic File and Directory Operations:
# Print current working directory:
pwd**

# Show files in current directory:
ls

# Show maximum information about all files, including hidden:
ls -a

# Recurse into subdirectories and list those as well:
ls -R

# List files by modification time, most recent first.
ls -lt

# Move/rename a file or directory (be careful that you don't move the source over a destination with the same name):
mv source destination

# Delete target forever (be very careful), use -r recursive flag for directories:
rm target

# Copy file or directory:
cp source destination

# Mount filesytem:
mount /dev/device\_name /media/device\_name

# Unmount:
umount /media/device\_name

# Forensically clone filesystems and do other low-level operations on files. Be careful with this one. Can be destructive:
dd

# Work with disk partitions:
parted

# Filesystem creation tool:
mkfs

 System Administration:

# Execute command as an administrator (can be destructive/insecure. Use only for system administration tasks):
sudo command

# Become system administrator:
sudo -s

# Quit system administration:
exit

# Forgot to type sudo in front of a command and already hit enter? Repeat the last command using sudo:
sudo !!

**Installing software from a .tgz (also known as a tarball):**

# First, unzip the tarball (see section on tar, below)
# Next, move into unzipped directory:
cd software\_directory

# Always read README first if it is provided, in case there are any modifications to the procedure outlined below:
cat README

# Automatically check for appropriate configurations and generate a MAKE file in the directory:
./configure

# Compile software. May require sudo:
make

# Move files into their appropriate locations. May also require sudo:
make install

# Clean up files in directory, in case make command fails, or just to remove unnecessary cruft:
make clean

**Ubuntu/Debian Software repositories:**

# Check distro repositories for software updates:
sudo apt-get update

# Download and install updates (update first):
sudo apt-get upgrade

# Search for package in the repositories:
apt-cache search keyword

# Get more detail on one specific package:
apt-cache show package\_name

# Download and install a package:
sudo apt-get install package\_name

# View the output of a command in a more convenient format:
command | less

 Working With Files:

# Print a file in terminal:
cat file

# Find files matching filename:
locate filename

# See the version of a program or the location of the program
which appname

# Search through filename for matches to phrase:
grep phrase filename

# Search through output of a command for phrase:
command | grep phrase

 Working With Processes:

# List all running processes:
ps -e

# Standard system monitor showing a more extensive view of all processes and system resources:
top

# Like top, but with a better, cleaner interface:
htop

# Stop a process from using all system resources and lagging computer:
renice process\_name

# Kill misbehaving process (use sparingly, last resort, try 'renice' command first):
pkill process name

# Start a process in the background
command &

# Start a process in the background and have it keep running after you log off
nohup command &

 Compression and Encryption:

# Make a simple compressed backup of files or directories:
tar -cvzf backup\_output.tgz target\_files\_or\_directories

# Open a compressed .tgz or .tar.gz file:
tar -xvf target.tgz

# Encrypt a file:
gpg -o outputfilename.gpg -c target\_file

# Decrypt a file:
gpg -o outputfilename -d target.gpg

# Zip and encrypt a directory simultaneously:
gpg-zip -o encrypted\_filename.tgz.gpg -c -s file\_to\_be\_encrypted

**The Bash shell:****File Name expansions:
# Current user's home directory:
~/**

# Current directory:
./

# Parent directory:
../

# Or even (Two parent directories down):
../../

# All files in target directory. (Be very careful.):
/

 Output Redirects:

# Redirect output of one command into the input of another with a pipe:
command\_1 | command\_2

# Or even:

command\_1 | command\_2 | command\_3

# Redirect output to a file:
command > file

# Or:

file > file

# Or even, to redirect in a different direction:
file < file

# Append output rather than writing over the target file:

file\_or\_command >> file

# Works like |, but it writes output to both target and terminal:
tee target

# Redirect standard output and error to /dev/null, where it is deleted.
command > /dev/null 2>&1

 Controlling Execution:
# Wait until command 1 is finished to execute command 2
command\_1 ; command\_2

# Or even:
command\_1 ; command\_2 ; command\_3

# && acts like ; but only executes command\_2 if command\_1 indicates that it succeeded without error by returning 0.
command\_1 && command\_2

# || acts like && but only executes command\_2 if command\_1 indicates an error by returning 1.
command\_1 || command\_2

 Bash Wildcards:
# Zero or more characters:


# Matches "phrase" and any number of trailing characters:
phrase

# Matches any incidences of "phrase" with any trailing or leading chars:
**phrase**

# Matches any one char:
?

# Matches any of the characters listed inside brackets:
[chars](chars.md)

# Matches a range of chars between a-z:
[a-z]

 Advanced:
**Command Line Utilities, Continued:****Networking:**

# Configure network interfaces:
ifconfig

# Configure wireless network interfaces:
iwconfig

# Connect to a remote server.
ssh username@ip\_address

# Forward X from target to current machine (Get a remote desktop. Somewhat obscure, but very useful):
ssh -X username@ip\_address

# Copy files/directory over the network from one machine to another recursively:
scp -r source\_filename:username@ip\_address target\_filename:target\_username@target\_ip\_address

# Copy only changes between files or directories (super efficient way to sync directories, works either locally or with remote servers using username@ip\_address:optionalport, just like ssh):
rsync source target

# Check to see if target is online and responding
ping ip\_address

# View network route to target:
traceroute6 ip\_address

# Network Monitor
netstat

# View firewall rules
iptables -L

# Scan this machine(localhost) to check for open ports:

**wget:**

# download a file over http:
wget http://example.com/folder/file

# complete a partially downloaded file:

# download a file from ftp server:
wget --ftp-user=USER --ftp-password=PASS [ftp://example.com/folder/file](ftp://example.com/folder/file)

**netcat:**

# Listen for input from network on recieving\_port, dump it to a file (insecure, but handy):
netcat -l recieving\_port > file\_copied

# Pipe the output of a command to a target ip and port over the network:
command | netcat -w number\_of\_seconds\_before\_timeout target\_ip target\_port

# Use tar to compress and output a file as a stream, pipe it to a target ip and port over the network:
sudo tar -czf - filename | netcat -w number\_of\_seconds\_before\_timeout target\_ip target\_port
